The goal is to write papers in a fast, reproducible, and efficient way. The goal is to also write really, really good papers that are styled in a high quality manner. 


# Folder Structure
## Root Directory

Except the `README.md` and `main.tex`, there should be no files in the root. They should be put into one of the other folders, wherever it makes sense.

### `main.tex`

The `main.tex` file should only be a resting ground for content. No content should be added here, and must only be imported. This allows reproducibility, and conversion to various formats easily.
